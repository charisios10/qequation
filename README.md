# Quadratic Equation Solver Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the **Quadratic Equations Guide** – an open-source guide to understanding and solving quadratic equations with ease!

## What is a Quadratic Equation?

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, written in the standard form:

```
ax² + bx + c = 0
```

where `a ≠ 0`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants.

## Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations

### 1. **Quadratic Formula** ✨

The most reliable method for solving any quadratic equation:

```
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
```

### 2. **Factoring (Soon...)** 🎯 

Break down the equation into two linear factors and solve.

### 3. **Completing the Square** 📐

Rewrite the equation in perfect square form.

### 4. **Graphing** 📊

Plot the parabola and find where it intersects the x-axis.
